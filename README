README for Hexer version 1.0.3

Hexer is a multi-buffer editor for binary files for Unix-like systems
that displays its buffer(s) as a hex dump.  The user interface is kept
similar to vi/ex.

All POSIX-compatible environments should be supported.

If you port Hexer to a different platform, please send an email-message
telling what changes you made (if any).

Please read the files `COPYRIGHT' and `hexer.doc'.

INSTALL:
	- To unpack hexer (you've probably done this already), type
		gunzip < hexer-1.0.3.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
	  Change into the newly-created hexer-1.0.3/ subdirectory.
	- Type `make'.
	- If you want a command line version of the builtin calculator "myc",
	  type `make myc'.
	- Type `make install' to install the binaries and the manual.
