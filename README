README for Hexer version 0.1.5

Hexer is a multi buffer editor for binary files for UN*X that displays its
buffer(s) as hex dump.  The user interface is kept similar to vi/ex.

The following systems are supported:

 - SunOS 4.x.x
 - Linux
 - FreeBSD
 - Irix

If you port Hexer to a different platform, please send an email-message
telling what changes you made (if any).

Please read the files `COPYRIGHT' and `hexer.doc'.

INSTALL:
	- To unpack hexer (you've probably done this already), type
		gunzip < hexer-0.1.5.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
	  where xxx is the version number.  This will create a subdirectory
	  `hexer-xxx'.  Change into that directory.
	- There are several configuration files named `config.xxx' where
	  xxx is the name of the operation system.  Check if theres a
	  config-file for your system and copy it to `config.h'.  If there's
	  no config-file for your system, you can use `config.any' and
	  modify it appropriately.
	- Skim trough `config.h' and `Makefile'.
	- Type `make'.
	- If you want a command line version of the builtin calculator "myc",
	  type `make myc'.
	- Type `make install' to install the binaries and the manual.
