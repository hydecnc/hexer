README for Hexer version 1.0.0

Hexer is a multi buffer editor for binary files for UN*X that displays its
buffer(s) as hex dump.  The user interface is kept similar to vi/ex.

All POSIX-compatible environments should be supported.

If you port Hexer to a different platform, please send an email-message
telling what changes you made (if any).

Please read the files `COPYRIGHT' and `hexer.doc'.

INSTALL:
	- To unpack hexer (you've probably done this already), type
		gunzip < hexer-1.0.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
	  Change into the newly-created hexer-1.0.0/ subdirectory.
	- There are several configuration files named `config.xxx' where
	  xxx is the name of the operation system or build environment.
	  Please try the build with config.posix first (except on GNU/Linux
	  systems where config.linux enables some optimizations).  Only try
	  some of the other config.* files if hexer cannot be built or does
	  not run properly; in that case, please let the author know!
	- Skim trough `config.h' and `Makefile'.
	- Type `make'.
	- If you want a command line version of the builtin calculator "myc",
	  type `make myc'.
	- Type `make install' to install the binaries and the manual.
