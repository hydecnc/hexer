Change log for hexer, the multi-view binary editor

0.1.5
	- taken over by Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>
	- remove the "bdir" and "ef" settings from the Vim modelines to
	  make them actually acceptable to today's Vim
	- add a config.posix file to reflect a modern POSIX-like system
	- bring config.linux up to date
	- add a HAVE_STRERROR definition to the config files and roll out
	  our own strerror() function if needed
	- clean up the header files:
	  - remove "extern" before the function prototypes
	  - declare all the hexer functions and variables used by
	    other modules
	  - add several header files so that all hexer functions and
	    variables are declared
	- clean up the source files:
	  - remove the "extern" definitions for the standard C library
	    functions - just include the header files instead
	  - replace the "extern" definitions for hexer functions and
	    variables with the appropriate includes
	  - fix various C compiler warnings
	- clean up the Makefile:
	  - allow the user to override most of the variables
	  - no need to ignore the result of "rm -f" :)
	  - use CFLAGS when building bin2c
	  - do not try to follow dependencies for termlib.c
	- rename the KEY_* constants to HXKEY_* to avoid conflicts with
	  the curses header files
	- add an "hx_" prefix to the "lines", "columns", and
	  "insert_character" variables for the same reason

0.1.4c
	- the last version released by Sascha Demetrio <demetrio@cs.uni-sb.de>
